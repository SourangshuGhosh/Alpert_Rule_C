double *r8vec_linspace_new ( int n, double a, double b )

/******************************************************************************/
/*
  Purpose:

    R8VEC_LINSPACE_NEW creates a vector of linearly spaced values.

  Discussion:

    An R8VEC is a vector of R8's.

    4 points evenly spaced between 0 and 12 will yield 0, 4, 8, 12.
 
    In other words, the interval is divided into N-1 even subintervals,
    and the endpoints of intervals are used as the points.

  Parameters:

    Input, int N, the number of entries in the vector.

    Input, double A, B, the first and last entries.

    Output, double R8VEC_LINSPACE_NEW[N], a vector of linearly spaced data.
